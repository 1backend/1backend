# Welcome to 1Backend

1Backend is the culmination of nearly two decades of microservices veterans’ journey toward productivity in distributed‑systems environments.

Although web frameworks are abundant and sophisticated, they’re not built with microservices architectures in mind and often struggle to scale across large fleets of servers. As a result, many startups and enterprise teams hand‑roll their own distributed platforms—there simply isn’t a clear winner in this space. Unlike the more unified JavaScript ecosystem, the backend world remains highly fragmented by a multitude of languages and tools.

When organizations venture into this territory, they can suffer—and even endure a 100×—productivity drop. At first, they may shrug it off—after all, they can hire more expensive engineers—but in practice, lengthy rewrites or “next‑generation platforms” can grind an entire company to a halt, costing market leaders their competitive edge.

Conceived in the author’s mind for over ten years, 1Backend aspires to be the operating system for distributed backend applications—offering a unified, scalable foundation that finally brings cohesion and efficiency to a fragmented landscape.

## Running the server

The first step is to run the daemon. For details about that, see [Running the Server](/docs/category/running-the-server).

## Built-in services

For a quick overview about what the system is capable, read through the [Built-in Service Docs](/docs/category/built-in-services).

## Building your services
