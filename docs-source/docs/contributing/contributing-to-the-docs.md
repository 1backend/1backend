# Contribute to the Docs

Step into the `docs-source` folder from the repo root and run `npm run start` to see the `Documentation` section in live reload mode.

However, the `API` section won't refresh automatically. To change the `API`, you must edit the Go endpoints and run `bash build.sh` in the `docs-source` folder.

You can run `bash build.sh` while `npm run start` is active for a relatively quick feedback loop.
