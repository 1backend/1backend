# Your first service

While 1Backend itself is written in Go, services that run on 1Backend can be written in any language.
A service only needs a few things to fully function:

- Register a user account, just like a human user. For details, see the [User Svc](/docs/built-in-services/user-svc).
- Register its instance in the registry so 1Backend knows where to route requests.

## A Go example

The following Go service demonstrates these steps:

- Registers itself as a user with the slug `skeleton-svc`
- Registers or updates its URL (`http://127.0.0.1:9311`) in the [Registry](/docs/built-in-services/registry-svc).

You may notice that the following code uses a "Go SDK," but it's simply a set of convenience functions built on top of the 1Backend API.
1Backend is language-agnostic and can be used with any language, even if no SDK is available in the repository.

```go
// <!-- INCLUDE: ./first-service-go/main.go -->
