    * Service who owns the permission  Uncertain if this aligns with the system\'s use of slugs. Issue encountered: I renamed Docker Svc to Container Svc in two steps (by mistake). The name/slug had already changed to \"container-svc,\" but data was still being saved in the \"dockerSvcCredentials\" table. After renaming the tables as well, I hit a \"cannot update unowned permission\" error because ownership relies on this field rather than the user slug. YMMV.
