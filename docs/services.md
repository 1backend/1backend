# Services

Services are a collection of lambda functions exposed to the outside world as
HTTP endpoints.

### Service privacy

#### Private vs public

Private services are unlisted, only you can see them.

#### Closed source, open source, open data

There are three levels of "openness":

* Closed source services only publish their types and API, so others can consume
  them.
* Open source services publish their source code
* Open data services publish their source and their data

By default every service is open source.
