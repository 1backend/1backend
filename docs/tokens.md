# Tokens

When [quotas](quotas.md) are enabled, tokens are required to [call](services.md#how-to-call-a-service) any 1Backend service.

They are used to reduce the quota of a user. This mostly useful if you want to limit and track the usage of your users/apps or use 1Backend as a seller of cloud hosting services (ie. host it yourself and charge your users).
