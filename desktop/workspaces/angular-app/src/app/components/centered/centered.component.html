<!--
The Core Issue with <ng-content> and *ngIf
Single Projection: Content projected using <ng-content> can only be projected once.
If you attempt to conditionally display it in multiple places using *ngIf, Angular will not duplicate the content.
Once content has been projected to a location in the DOM, it cannot be re-projected or moved.
Directive Evaluation Order:
The *ngIf directive can prevent content from being projected at all if it evaluates to false because Angular removes the element (and its children) from the DOM.

<ng-template #content>
	<ng-content></ng-content>
</ng-template>

<div *ngIf="!vertical" class="horizontally-centered-content">
	<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="content"></ng-container>
</div>

<div *ngIf="vertical">
	<div
		class="vertically-centered-container"
		[ngStyle]="{ 'min-height': 'calc(100vh - ' + headerHeight + ')' }"
	>
		<div class="horizontally-centered-content">
			<ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="content"></ng-container>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
